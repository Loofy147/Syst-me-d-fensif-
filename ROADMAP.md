# Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction of the Autonomous Learning System project.

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 months)

*   **Implement a comprehensive testing framework.** This will include unit tests for all the major components of the system, as well as integration tests to ensure that the different modules are working together correctly.
*   **Add a configuration file.** This will allow users to easily configure the system's parameters, such as the number of generations to run, the size of the attack campaigns, and the strength of the initial defenses.
*   **Improve the logging and reporting.** This will make it easier to track the system's progress and to debug any issues that may arise.

## Mid-Term Goals (3-6 months)

*   **Develop a web-based user interface.** This will provide a more user-friendly way to interact with the system and to visualize the results of the learning process.
*   **Add support for more attack scenarios and defense mechanisms.** This will make the system more robust and more effective at countering a wider range of threats.
*   **Implement a more sophisticated meta-learning algorithm.** This will allow the system to learn how to learn more effectively over time.

## Long-Term Goals (6-12 months)

*   **Integrate the system with real-world security systems.** This will allow the system to be used to protect live applications and networks from cyber attacks.
*   **Open source the project.** This will allow the community to contribute to the development of the system and to help it to become the standard for autonomous cyber defense.
