# Architecture

The Autonomous Learning System is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension. The system is composed of the following key components:

## Architectural Diagram

A detailed architectural diagram is available in the `docs/defense_architecture.puml` file. This diagram provides a visual representation of the system's components and their interactions.

To render the diagram, you can use the PlantUML extension for your IDE (e.g., VS Code) or the online PlantUML editor at [plantuml.com](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).

## Core

The `core` module provides the fundamental building blocks of the system. It defines the data structures and classes that are used throughout the application, such as `EvolvableSeed`, `DefenseType`, and `AttackPattern`.

## Attacks

The `attacks` module is responsible for generating and orchestrating the simulated cyber attacks that the system learns from. It is divided into two sub-modules:

*   **`advanced`**: Contains a library of advanced attack techniques, such as polymorphic payloads, encoding obfuscation, and logic bombs.
*   **`orchestration`**: Contains the logic for combining the advanced attacks into complex, multi-stage scenarios.

## Defenses

The `defenses` module contains the various defense mechanisms that the system can deploy to counter the simulated attacks. It is divided into two sub-modules:

*   **`advanced`**: Contains a set of sophisticated defense mechanisms, such as multi-layer decoding, deep object inspection, and introspection-based bounds enforcement.
*   **`evolution`**: Contains the logic for evolving the defense mechanisms over time in response to the attacks that the system encounters.

## Intelligence

The `intelligence` module is the "brains" of the operation. It is responsible for learning from the results of the simulated attacks and for synthesizing new defense strategies. It is composed of the following key components:

*   **`AttackKnowledgeBase`**: A self-building knowledge base of attack patterns.
*   **`ReasoningEngine`**: Analyzes attacks and synthesizes defensive strategies.
*   **`AdaptiveDefenseSynthesizer`**: Synthesizes new defense mechanisms from learned principles.
*   **`AutonomousIntelligence`**: Coordinates all intelligence components.

## Orchestration

The `orchestration` module contains the main learning loop of the system. It is responsible for orchestrating the interactions between the other modules, such as generating attack campaigns, testing the defenses, and processing the results.
