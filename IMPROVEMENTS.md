# Potential Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements to the Autonomous Learning System.

## New Features

*   **GUI:** A graphical user interface would make the system more user-friendly and easier to use.
*   **Real-time monitoring:** The ability to monitor the system's performance in real time would be a valuable addition.
*   **Integration with other security tools:** The system could be integrated with other security tools, such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls.

## Performance Optimizations

*   **Caching:** The system could be optimized by caching the results of expensive computations.
*   **Parallelization:** The system could be parallelized to take advantage of multi-core processors.
*   **Code optimization:** The code could be optimized to improve its performance.

## Security Hardening

*   **Input validation:** The system's input validation could be improved to prevent a wider range of attacks.
*   **Error handling:** The system's error handling could be improved to prevent information leakage.
*   **Security auditing:** The system could be audited for security vulnerabilities.
